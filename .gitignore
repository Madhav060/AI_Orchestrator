# It's good practice to not commit large, auto-generated datasets to Git.
# Your notebook creates these files in the /data directory.

data/*.json

# If you have specific raw data files you WANT to keep, make an exception.
# For example, to keep an original problem file, you would add:
# !data/raw_problem_data.json
